**What movies should we watch on our next all-day movie marathon?**

This web app helps with that decision! Participants can suggest any movies and vote them! Then let's watch the ones with the top scores!

The web app has the following features:

- Sign in with your Facebook or Google account
- Create a movie poll and share the URL with your friends
- Search for movies from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and suggest them
- Vote for movies with +1, Â±0, or -1
- Mark movies that you have already seen
- See details about how others have voted

**This app is built on top of the [Broilerplate](https://github.com/ktkiiski/broilerplate) and is powered by the [BroilerKit framework](https://github.com/ktkiiski/broilerkit)**!
